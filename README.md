# lowres-mspaint

A minimal demonstration of exception handling in C++ that mimics an extremely low-resolution MS Paint.

This project contains a simple console application written in C++. It illustrates basic object-oriented structure and exception safety, while simulating a low-fidelity, static MS Paint–like program.

## Features

- Basic C++ structure with `main` entry point.
- A `Painter` class that encapsulates core drawing behavior.
- Demonstrates exception handling patterns in a simple context.
- No graphics library dependencies — output is textual / conceptual.

> **Note:** This is not a fully featured paint program. The objective is to demonstrate coding fundamentals, not to provide a graphic editor. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
